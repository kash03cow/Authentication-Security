This project aims to enhance password authentication security by analyzing users' unique keystroke patterns. 
It combines user-specific keystroke dynamics with advanced machine learning techniques to create a robust
authentication system that can accurately differentiate legitimate users from potential imposters.

## Key Features

Keystroke Data Collection: Captures keystroke timing information, including dwell time, flight time, and pressure, to create a unique profile for each user.
Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features from raw keystroke data to represent typing patterns effectively.
Machine Learning Models:
Random Forest: Leverages an ensemble of decision trees for robust classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Employs kernel methods to find optimal decision boundaries in high-dimensional feature spaces.
Adaptive Learning: Continuously updates user profiles as their typing patterns evolve over time, ensuring sustained accuracy.
